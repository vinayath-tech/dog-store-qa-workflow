# Prompt: Browser Validation via Chrome MCP

> **Use when**: You have a PR to validate and want AI to test the feature in a real browser.
> **Requires**: Chrome MCP server running, feature branch checked out and application running locally.
> **Reads**: `qa-output/test-scenarios.md` (or user-provided scenarios), `qa-output/environment-status.md`
> **Writes**: `qa-output/browser-validation.md`

---

## Prerequisites

1. Chrome MCP server is running and connected (check `.mcp.json`)
2. Feature branch is checked out and application is running (check `qa-output/environment-status.md`)
   - If not running, use the `environment-manager` skill first
3. Test scenarios exist in `qa-output/test-scenarios.md` (or will be provided inline)
   - If not available, use the `test-scenario-designer` skill first

## Instructions

Read `context/CONTEXT.md` for the application URL and environment details.
Read `qa-output/environment-status.md` to confirm the app is running from the correct branch.
Read `qa-output/test-scenarios.md` for the scenarios to validate.

For each **Must Test** and **Should Test** scenario in the scenario table:

1. **Navigate** to the relevant page using Chrome MCP
2. **Take a snapshot** to understand the current page state
3. **Execute** the steps exactly as written in the scenario
4. **Verify** the expected result by inspecting the page (text, elements, visibility, values)
5. **Take a screenshot** on FAIL results (PASS screenshots are optional)
6. **Record** the verdict: PASS, FAIL, or BLOCKED

### How to execute steps via Chrome MCP

- **Navigation**: Use `navigate_page` to go to URLs
- **Read page state**: Use `take_snapshot` to get the accessibility tree — this shows all visible elements with their text, roles, and unique IDs (uid)
- **Form input**: Use `take_snapshot` to find element UIDs, then `fill` to enter data
- **Clicks**: Use `click` on button/link UIDs from the snapshot
- **Verification**: Use `take_snapshot` to read page state after an action, compare against expected result
- **Evidence**: Use `take_screenshot` to capture visual state (save to `qa-output/screenshots/`)
- **Waiting**: Use `wait_for` when expecting dynamic content to appear after an action
- **Network**: Use `list_network_requests` to verify API calls are made

### Verification patterns

| What to verify | How |
|---|---|
| Element is visible | `take_snapshot`, find the element's uid in the tree |
| Text content matches | `take_snapshot`, check StaticText content for the element |
| Navigation occurred | Check the page URL after clicking a link |
| API call was made | `list_network_requests`, look for the expected endpoint |
| Form submission worked | Fill + click submit, then `take_snapshot` to check for success/error state |
| Element is NOT visible | `take_snapshot`, confirm the element is absent from the tree |

### What NOT to automate via browser

- Scenarios requiring email/SMS verification (mark as `BLOCKED — requires external service`)
- Scenarios requiring multi-user concurrency (mark as `BLOCKED — requires parallel sessions`)
- Scenarios dependent on specific test data not available in the environment

## Output format

Save to `qa-output/browser-validation.md`.

## Browser Validation Report

**Ticket**: [TICKET-ID]
**Feature**: [Feature name]
**URL**: [base URL used]
**Branch**: [branch name(s) checked out]
**Date**: [date]
**Method**: AI-driven via Chrome MCP

### Results Summary

| Status | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ PASS | [N] | [%] |
| ❌ FAIL | [N] | [%] |
| 🚫 BLOCKED | [N] | [%] |
| **Total** | **[N]** | **100%** |

### Detailed Results

| ID | Scenario | Steps Executed | Expected | Actual | Status | Screenshot |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TS-001 | [name] | 1. Navigated to /<br>2. Checked element | [expected] | [actual observation] | ✅ PASS | — |
| TS-002 | [name] | 1. Navigated to /<br>2. Clicked CTA | [expected] | [actual observation] | ❌ FAIL | screenshot-002.png |

### Failed Checks

#### TS-002: [Name]
- **Step that failed**: [which step]
- **Expected**: [what should happen]
- **Actual**: [what actually happened]
- **Screenshot**: screenshot-002.png
- **Severity assessment**: Critical / Major / Minor
- **Bug report recommended**: Yes / No

### Network Observations
- [API calls observed during validation]
- [Any failed requests, unexpected endpoints, slow responses]

### UI Observations
- [Layout issues, missing elements, console errors]
- [Elements that were difficult to locate or interact with]

### Verdict
**Overall**: ✅ APPROVED / ⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / ❌ REJECTED
```

## Rules

- Only attempt Must Test and Should Test scenarios. Skip Could Test.
- Always take a snapshot before interacting — UIDs change between page loads.
- If a step cannot be performed via browser (e.g., requires backend state setup), mark BLOCKED with reason.
- Take a screenshot for every FAIL. Screenshots for PASS are optional.
- If the application is not running or the URL is unreachable, stop immediately and report — use `environment-manager` to fix.
- Do not modify application data or state beyond what the scenario requires.
- Check `list_network_requests` after page loads to verify API integration is working.
