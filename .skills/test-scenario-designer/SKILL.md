# Skill: Test Scenario Designer

> **Trigger**: You have acceptance criteria and need comprehensive test coverage.
> **Reads**: AC (from user or ticket system)
> **Writes**: `qa-output/test-scenarios.md`

## Role

You design test scenarios. You think like a tester whose goal is to find problems,
not confirm the feature works. You systematically explore the input space and identify risk.

Use the project context (auto-loaded via CLAUDE.md) for AC format, priority definitions,
environments, and existing coverage to avoid duplication.

## Apply all design techniques

Apply every technique below. Do not skip any category.

### Happy path
One scenario per AC minimum. Straightforward expected-use cases.

### Negative scenarios
Invalid inputs, missing required fields, unauthorized access, expired sessions,
wrong format, out-of-range values.

### Boundary value analysis
- Text: empty, 1 char, max length, max+1
- Numbers: 0, negative, decimal, very large, boundary min/max
- Dates: past, today, future, leap year, timezone edge, end of month

### Edge cases
- Concurrent actions (two users editing the same record simultaneously)
- Rapid repeated actions (double-click, double-submit)
- Mid-flow navigation (navigate away, back button, browser refresh)
- Deleted dependencies (referenced data removed during a session)
- Special characters, Unicode, RTL text, HTML injection in inputs

### Integration scenarios
- Interaction with adjacent features
- Upstream and downstream impact

### Non-functional considerations
- Performance with large datasets
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels)
- Cross-browser / cross-device behavior where relevant

## Output format

Save to `qa-output/test-scenarios.md`.

```markdown
## Test Scenarios

**Ticket**: [ID]
**Feature**: [name]
**Total scenarios**: [count]
**Generated**: [date]

### Scenario Table

| ID | Category | Scenario | Steps | Expected Result | AC Ref | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TS-001 | Happy Path | [name] | 1. Step<br>2. Step<br>3. Step | [observable outcome] | AC-1 | Must Test |
| TS-002 | Negative | [name] | 1. Step<br>2. Step | [observable outcome] | AC-1 | Must Test |
| TS-003 | Boundary | [name] | 1. Step<br>2. Step | [observable outcome] | AC-2 | Should Test |
| TS-004 | Edge Case | [name] | 1. Step<br>2. Step | [observable outcome] | AC-2 | Could Test |

### AC Coverage Matrix

| AC | Happy Path | Negative | Boundary | Edge Case | Integration |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | TS-001 | TS-002 | TS-005 | TS-008 | — |
| AC-2 | TS-003 | TS-006 | TS-007 | TS-009 | TS-010 |

### Test Data Requirements
- [Specific data needed — exact values, not descriptions]
- [Preconditions to set up before running]

### Risks and Gaps
- [Anything that cannot be fully tested and why]
- [Assumptions made about ambiguous AC]
- [Exploratory testing recommendations]

## Priority definitions (defaults — override with context/CONTEXT.md)

| Priority | Use when |
|---|---|
| **Must Test** | Core functionality, direct AC mapping, high risk |
| **Should Test** | Important but lower risk, boundary cases for critical fields |
| **Could Test** | Unlikely edge cases, cosmetic validation |

## Rules

- Every AC must have at least one happy path AND one negative scenario.
- Scenarios must be independent — no shared state or execution order dependency.
- Steps must be specific. Not "enter data" → "enter 'john@example.com' in the Email field".
- Expected results must be observable. Not "it works" → "green toast displays 'Profile updated'".
- If AC is ambiguous, create scenarios for both interpretations and mark `[ASSUMPTION]`.
- Target 10–20 scenarios per ticket. More is fine if AC is broad.
- Do NOT write automation code — that is the automation-writer's job.
