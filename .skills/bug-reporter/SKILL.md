description: Turns QA findings into structured, developer-ready bug reports

# Skill: Bug Reporter

> **Trigger**: Gaps or findings exist and need to become structured bug reports.
> **Reads**: `qa-output/functional-review.md` (or user-provided findings)
> **Writes**: `qa-output/bug-reports.md`

## Role

You turn QA findings into developer-ready bug reports.
One finding = one report. No grouping. No summarizing.
Each report must let a developer reproduce and fix the bug without asking questions.

Use the project context (auto-loaded via CLAUDE.md) for bug report format, severity/priority
definitions, environment names, and terminology.

## Process each finding

For every Critical or Concern item in the functional review:
1. Create one dedicated bug report.
2. Determine severity and priority from context definitions (not your own judgment).
3. Write steps that are immediately reproducible — no missing context.

## Output format

Save to `qa-output/bug-reports.md`. One `---` separator between reports.

```markdown
## Bug Report

**Title**: [Component] Verb + object + condition
**Parent Ticket**: [ID]
**Severity**: Critical / Major / Minor / Trivial
**Priority**: P1 / P2 / P3 / P4
**Component**: [affected module or service]
**Environment**: [where this can be reproduced]

### Description
[1–2 sentences. What is broken and what is the user impact.]

### Steps to Reproduce
1. [Precise step — no ambiguity]
2. [Precise step]
3. [Precise step — include exact data values used]

### Expected Result
[What should happen per AC or spec.]

### Actual Result
[What actually happens. Include exact error messages if available.]

### Additional Context
- **AC reference**: [AC-X from the functional review]
- **Code reference**: `[file:line]` if from code review
- **Frequency**: Always / Intermittent / Once
- **Workaround**: [if any, otherwise "None"]

### Attachments
[List what the developer will need: screenshots, logs, recordings, test data]

## Severity definitions (defaults — override with context/CONTEXT.md)

| Severity | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Data loss, security vulnerability, system unusable, no workaround |
| **Major** | Core feature broken, workaround exists but painful |
| **Minor** | Feature works but with non-critical issues |
| **Trivial** | Cosmetic only, no functional impact |

## Rules

- One bug per report. If a finding contains multiple issues, split them.
- Title format: `[Area] Verb + what + condition`. Not: "Button broken". Yes: "[Checkout] Submit button stays disabled after all required fields are filled".
- Steps must be reproducible by a developer who has never seen the feature.
- Always include expected vs. actual.
- Do not assign blame or speculate on root cause without evidence from the diff.
- If a finding is an AC ambiguity (not a bug), create a separate "Question" section at the end, not a bug report.
