# Prompt: Smart Test Selector

> **Use when**: You have a diff and want to know which **existing** tests are affected — without running the full suite.
> **This is test selection, not test generation.** It maps code changes to your current test coverage.
> **Reads**: Git diff + existing test files in the QA repo
> **Writes**: `qa-output/test-selection.md`

---

## Instructions

Read `context/CONTEXT.md` for:
- QA repo location and test directory structure
- Test file naming convention (`*.spec.ts`, `*.feature`, etc.)
- Test tags used (`@smoke`, `@regression`, etc.)
- Test run command

### Step 1 — Understand the change

Read the diff. For each changed file, identify:
- What function, component, or endpoint was modified
- What user-facing behaviour is affected

### Step 2 — Scan existing tests

Search the QA repo test directory for tests that:
- Import or reference the changed file/module
- Test the affected user flow (by name, route, or feature area)
- Use test data related to the changed functionality

```bash
# Example: find tests related to cart changes
grep -r "cart" <qa-repo>/e2e/ --include="*.spec.ts" -l
grep -r "discount" <qa-repo>/e2e/ --include="*.spec.ts" -l
grep -r "/checkout" <qa-repo>/e2e/ --include="*.spec.ts" -l
```

### Step 3 — Classify each test

| Category | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Must Run** | Directly tests the changed behaviour | Run in CI, review expected values |
| **Should Run** | Tests adjacent flow that could regress | Include in targeted regression |
| **May Break** | Asserts a value that this change alters | Check and update expected values |
| **Unaffected** | No connection to the change | Skip or defer to full regression |

### Step 4 — Identify coverage gaps

Compare the changed code against the test inventory:
- Is every changed function/endpoint covered by at least one test?
- Are there new code paths with no test?
- Did the change add a new edge case that no existing test covers?

## Output format

Save to `qa-output/test-selection.md`.

## Smart Test Selection

**Diff source**: [branch, PR, or commit range]
**QA repo**: [path]
**Date**: [date]

### Changed code → affected tests

| Changed file | What changed | Affected tests | Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cart-service.ts:142` | Discount calc: pre-tax | `checkout.spec.ts` (lines 45–78) | Must Run |
| `cart-service.ts:142` | Discount calc: pre-tax | `discount-stacking.spec.ts` | Must Run |
| `cart-service.ts:142` | Discount calc: pre-tax | `cart-summary.spec.ts` (line 92) | May Break |
| `user-profile.component.ts` | Avatar border radius | — | Unaffected (no test) |

### Recommended test run

```bash
# Must Run — directly affected (run first)
npx playwright test checkout.spec.ts discount-stacking.spec.ts

# Should Run — adjacent flows
npx playwright test cart-summary.spec.ts order-confirmation.spec.ts

# Full command with tags
npx playwright test --grep "@checkout|@discount"
```

### Tests that may need updates

| Test file | Line | Current assertion | Why it may break |
|---|---|---|---|
| `checkout.spec.ts:67` | `expect(total).toBe('$108.50')` | Discount was post-tax, now pre-tax — expected value will change |
| `cart-summary.spec.ts:92` | `expect(discount).toBe('-$10.00')` | Discount amount display may differ |

### Coverage gaps

| Changed code | Coverage | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| `cart-service.ts` — stacked coupons path | None | No test for applying two discounts simultaneously |
| `cart-service.ts` — zero-amount discount | None | No test for 0% or $0 discount |

### Recommended new tests
- [Brief scenario description for each gap — hand off to test-scenario-designer if needed]

### Summary
**Tests to run**: [N] (out of [total] in suite)
**Time saved**: ~[estimate] by skipping [N] unaffected tests
**Gaps found**: [N] — recommend running test-scenario-designer for these
```

## Rules

- Search broadly. A change to a shared utility can affect tests you wouldn't expect.
- Check imports, not just file names — a test may reference a changed module indirectly.
- If the QA repo is not accessible, ask the user for the test file list.
- This prompt selects existing tests. For generating new tests, use `test-generation.prompt.md`.
- Always output the runnable command so the tester can execute immediately.
