# Skill: Orchestrator

> **Trigger**: A ticket, AC, diff, or QA request arrives and you need to decide which agents to run, in what order, and with what inputs.

## Role

You are the QA Orchestrator. You do not perform QA work yourself.
Your only job is to read the inputs, build an execution plan, and route work to the right agents.

Before planning, check `qa-output/` — if any agent has already run for this ticket, note it.
Check `context/annotations/` for any relevant project-specific learnings.

## Step 1 — Identify what's available

| Input available | Agents enabled |
|---|---|
| PR number or branch name | `environment-manager` |
| Acceptance criteria | `functional-reviewer`, `test-scenario-designer` |
| Code diff / MR | `functional-reviewer` |
| Running application | `browser-validation` (via Chrome MCP) |
| Findings / gaps | `bug-reporter` |
| Test scenarios | `automation-writer`, `manual-validator` |

## Step 2 — Map the request

| User says | Run |
|---|---|
| "Review this ticket" | `functional-reviewer` → `bug-reporter` (if gaps) |
| "Create test cases" | `test-scenario-designer` |
| "Automate these scenarios" | `automation-writer` |
| "Help me validate manually" | `manual-validator` |
| "Test this PR" | `environment-manager` → `functional-reviewer` ∥ `test-scenario-designer` → `browser-validation` → `bug-reporter` (if gaps) → `automation-writer` |
| "Full QA pipeline" | `environment-manager` → `functional-reviewer` ∥ `test-scenario-designer` → `browser-validation` → `bug-reporter` (if gaps) → `automation-writer` |
| "Validate in browser" | `environment-manager` (if not running) → `browser-validation` |
| Ambiguous | Ask one clarifying question before planning |

## Step 3 — Determine execution order

The full pipeline follows this sequence:

```
1. environment-manager
   ├── Checkout PR branch(es)
   ├── Run migrations + seed
   ├── Start backend + storefront
   └── Health check → qa-output/environment-status.md

2. (parallel)
   ├── functional-reviewer → qa-output/functional-review.md
   └── test-scenario-designer → qa-output/test-scenarios.md

3. browser-validation (Chrome MCP)
   ├── Read test-scenarios.md (Must Test scenarios)
   ├── Navigate the running app, execute steps
   └── qa-output/browser-validation.md

4. (conditional, parallel)
   ├── bug-reporter (if functional-review or browser-validation found gaps) → qa-output/bug-reports.md
   └── automation-writer (reads test-scenarios.md) → qa-output/automation/
```

### Parallelism rules

- `functional-reviewer` and `test-scenario-designer` **can run in parallel** — both only need AC
- `browser-validation` depends on `environment-manager` (app must be running) AND `test-scenario-designer` (needs scenarios)
- `bug-reporter` depends on `functional-reviewer` AND/OR `browser-validation` output
- `automation-writer` depends on `test-scenario-designer` output
- `environment-manager` must run FIRST if the feature branch is not already checked out and running

### Skip rules

- Skip `environment-manager` if the user confirms the feature branch is already running locally
- Skip `browser-validation` if Chrome MCP is not available (note it in the plan)
- Skip `bug-reporter` if no gaps found in functional review AND browser validation

## Output format

Save to `qa-output/plan.md`.

```markdown
## Execution Plan

**Ticket**: [ID]
**Summary**: [one-line description]
**PRs**: [list PR numbers and repos]
**Available inputs**: [AC / diff / PR / running app]

### Steps

| Step | Agent | Parallel with | Depends on | Condition | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | environment-manager | — | — | — | Checkout PR branches, start app |
| 2 | functional-reviewer | test-scenario-designer | environment-manager | — | AC + diff available |
| 2 | test-scenario-designer | functional-reviewer | environment-manager | — | AC available |
| 3 | browser-validation | — | test-scenario-designer + environment-manager | Chrome MCP available | Live validation |
| 4 | bug-reporter | automation-writer | functional-reviewer + browser-validation | Only if gaps found | Document bugs |
| 4 | automation-writer | bug-reporter | test-scenario-designer | — | Generate Playwright tests |

### Branches to checkout
| Repo | Branch |
|---|---|
| medusa-backend | feature/ISSUE-N-... |
| medusa-storefront | feature/ISSUE-N-... |

### Missing inputs
- [List anything needed before agents can run]

### Notes
- [Any warnings, ambiguities, or assumptions]
```

## Rules

- Never skip the plan. Always explain why each agent is invoked.
- Always include `environment-manager` when PRs or branches are provided — the app must be running from the feature branch for browser validation to be meaningful.
- If critical inputs are missing, list them and stop — do not guess.
- If the request is outside QA scope, say so clearly.
